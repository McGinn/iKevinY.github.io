# iKevinY.github.io

This repository contains both the source code and also the static site files for www.kevinyap.ca. The site is generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). In order to host with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), the repository contains two branches; the `src` branch houses the source files that Pelican uses to generate the static files and the `master` branch contains said files.

The website's styling is based on [Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com)'s [Simply](https://github.com/gjreda/gregreda.com/tree/master/theme/simply) theme.
