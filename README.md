# iKevinY.github.io

This repository contains both the source code and also the static site files for [http://kevinyap.ca](kevinyap.ca). The site is generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), a static site generator written in Python. In order to host with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), the repository contains two branches; the `src` branch houses the source files that Pelican uses to generate the static files and the `master` branch contains said files. `generate.sh` is used to test changes locally and push changes to the `master` branch. For further information, see [this blog post](http://kevinyap.ca/2013/12/hosting-with-github-pages/) about the process.

The website's styling is based on [Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com)'s [Simply](https://github.com/gjreda/gregreda.com/tree/master/theme/simply) theme, which is built with the [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) framework.
