Title: About Me
Slug: about

I am a developer and musician from Vancouver, BC, and can be found as [@iKevinY](https://twitter.com/iKevinY) on most online services. I enjoy programming, composing music, and playing the piano. Pictured in my avatar is the [lilac-breasted roller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac-breasted_Roller).

This website is generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), a static site generator written in Python. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and the source can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iKevinY/iKevinY.github.io). The design of this website is a modified version of the [Simply](https://github.com/gjreda/gregreda.com/tree/master/theme/simply) theme created by [Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com), which itself is built using [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com). The syntax highlighting in code blocks uses Chris Kempson's [Eighties Dark](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#eighties) theme.

These are some of the applications, websites, and technologies that I use on a regular basis:

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) -- source code editor with a wide variety of plugins available
- [Ulysses III](http://www.ulyssesapp.com) -- OS X exclusive text editor for composing prose in Markdown
- [GitHub](https://github.com) -- online Git-based project hosting
- [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com) -- hotkey-activatable terminal overlay
- [f.lux](http://justgetflux.com/) -- adjusts the colour temperature of displays at night to reduce eye strain
- [Rainwave](http://rainwave.cc/) -- video game music Internet radio station
- [Radium](http://catpigstudios.com) -- menu bar application for streaming Internet radio stations

Here some books that I highly recommend reading:

- [Code](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735611319/) -- Charles Petzold explains the design of computers and software in a manner accessible to even those without a background in computer science.
- [The Signal and the Noise](http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420411X) -- Nate Silver discusses how mathematical models created using probability and statistics are applied to real-world situations.
- [Guns, Germs, and Steel](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393317552) -- Jared Diamond argues the factors that led to the successes of certain civilizations over others.
