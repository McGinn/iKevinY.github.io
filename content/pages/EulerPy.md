Title: EulerPy

EulerPy is a command line tool designed to streamline the process of solving Project Euler problems using Python. The package focuses on two main tasks: firstly, to create Python "template" files with a docstring containing the text of a Project Euler problem for ease-of-reference, and secondly, to check whether a problem has been solved correctly. In addition to the package itself, the [EulerPy Wiki](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy/wiki) serves as a hub for various Project Euler-related resources.
