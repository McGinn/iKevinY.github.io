Title: Code Test

The following is `inline code`.

Next we have a Lua code block:

```lua
local n = 1
  lineTable[n] = ""
  for index, word in ipairs(wordTable) do
    if word == [[\n]] then -- checks if the "word" is a newline character
      n = n + 1
      lineTable[n] = ""
      n = n + 1
      lineTable[n] = ""
    -- Checks to see if adding the next word (first element of wordTable) will fit within the terminal
    elseif string.len(lineTable[n]) + string.len(tostring(word)) + 1 <= lineSpacing then
      if lineTable[n] ~= "" then
        lineTable[n] = lineTable[n] .. " " .. word
      else -- if the word would be the first of the string, don't add a leading space to the line (because it would be incorrect)
        lineTable[n] = tostring(word)
      end
    -- Otherwise make a new line and add the word to it
    else
      n = n + 1 -- move to next line in lineTable
      lineTable[n] = tostring(word)
    end
  end
```
