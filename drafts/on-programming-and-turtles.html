	<h1 class="article-title"><a href="/2013/12/on-programming-and-turtles/" title="Permalink to On Programming and&nbsp;Turtles">On Programming and&nbsp;Turtles</a></h1>
	<h6 class="article-date">December 09, 2013</h6>
	<div class="article-content"><p>Minecraft is one of my favourite games (the other being League of Legends). At the time of writing, over 12.9 million <span class="caps">PC</span> copies and over 33 million copies across all platforms have been sold &#8212; an impressive statistic considering the game was in alpha merely three years ago. Minecraft&#8217;s popularity is due in part to its open-ended nature. The constantly increasing variety of blocks appeal to those who enjoy the building aspect of the game, and the survival mode of Minecraft only augments the gratification of building by having the player work for their building materials. As for combat, there are numerous custom maps with their own unique rulesets, enabled by <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block">Command Blocks</a>, that have been created by the community and can be played over&nbsp;multiplayer.</p>
<p>The addition of <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone">Redstone</a> opened up an entirely new world in terms of gameplay. Minecraft Alpha 1.0.1 added <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone#Redstone_Dust">Redstone Dust</a> and <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Torch">Redstone Torches</a> to the game. The latter functions as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate)">signal inverter</a> while the former carries the current between various Redstone components. In conjunction with one another, it is possible to construct logic gates, and therefore, fully functional <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Advanced_redstone_circuits#Arithmetic_logic_unit">ALUs</a> and other more complex&nbsp;circuits.</p>
<p>Upon learning about it, the concept of Redstone captivated me; I had no experience with anything involving logic circuits prior to playing Minecraft. At first, using Redstone involved searching up designs that had the functionality that was required. However, as I became more experienced with Redstone, it became increasingly second-nature to build complex circuits based on their constituent logic gates rather than looking up circuit designs online. Many times, I would need to create a Redstone circuit that fits within the constraints of an existing structure, and this resulted in innovative ways to arrange each piece of circuitry. In other words, <em>playing Minecraft actually taught me how logic gates worked</em>. When picking up programming, handling boolean logic felt like second nature despite never having formally learned about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I think that one of the reasons that Redstone was so appealing was because while playing Minecraft, situations arose where building a Redstone circuit would be the solution to a problem I had in-game. The lack of tangibility of learning about boolean logic from other sources would have likely been discouraging. By learning through Minecraft instead, it felt substantial, even if the substance was within a video game. I thought back to this while learning how to program. Most of the coding examples that novice programmers are provided with simply output text to a terminal without any tangible product being produced. Many exercises teach how to write a program, but it may be difficult to bridge the cognitive gap between theory and practicality in terms of how lines of text can be applied to real-world&nbsp;scenarios.</p>
<h2>ComputerCraft and&nbsp;Turtles</h2>
<p>For a while, I limited myself to playing only vanilla Minecraft, as I felt that playing the game with mods would tarnish my appreciation of the original game. Having followed various <a href="http://www.guudelp.com">Mindcrackers&#8217;</a> <a href="http://feed-the-beast.com">Feed the Beast</a> series on YouTube for quite some time, I finally caved and installed the expansive mod pack. This added an immense &#8212; perhaps even unnecessary &#8212; amount of content to the game. The mod that I was most interested in was <a href="http://www.computercraft.info">ComputerCraft</a>, written by <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/dan200/">Daniel Ratcliffe</a>, which adds various blocks that can be programmed using <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>. Among these blocks are <a href="http://computercraft.info/wiki/Computer">Computers</a>, which are interactive terminals, but more interestingly, <a href="http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle">Turtles</a>, robots that can be scripted with&nbsp;Lua.</p>
<p>One of the things that could disincentive someone trying to learn how to program is that, at least during the learning stages, the only thing produced is pixels on a screen. In other fields, this is not the case; even the newest artists can produce visually interesting drawings or paintings, and a musician&#8217;s first composition will probably sound decent, even if it just follows a basic <span class="caps">IV</span>-V-<span class="caps">III</span>-<span class="caps">VI</span> chord progression. On the other hand, programmers who are just starting out typically are greeted with the <code>Hello World</code> being printed in front of themselves. Barring the intrinsic reward of learning a new skill, this is fairly lacklustre, and I feel that ComputerCraft solves this in an elegant way. By introducing programming through Turtle scripts, programming is repackaged as a task with a clear goal that can be worked towards. For example, if you notice that you&#8217;re lacking iron and diamonds, you could write a script that will instruct a Turtle to mine in search of ores. This makes programming gratifying by adding an extrinsic reward for writing&nbsp;scripts.</p>
<p>The terminology used in ComputerCraft is an obvious throwback to the programming language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> which featured so called &#8220;turtle graphics&#8221;. The language was largely designed for children and other people new to programming. In fact, Logo&#8217;s Wikipedia article states that &#8220;the design goals of Logo included accessible power and informative error messages&#8221; and that the &#8220;virtual Turtles allowed for immediate visual feedback and debugging&#8221;. With Turtles, ComputerCraft allows a novice programmer to use kinaesthetic reasoning to debug the actions of a Turtle in a similar manner that Logo was envisioned to do. Given all of these points, I feel that ComputerCraft very closely follows the design philosophy of Logo, essentially making it a modern version of what Logo was back in the 60s and&nbsp;70s.</p>
<h2>Digging for&nbsp;Ores</h2>
<p>The first major program that I wrote for Turtles was a branch mining script. My goal was to write a program that a swarm of Turtles could execute simultaneously to quickly mine an entire area for ores. I tend to be meticulous about following patterns when I mine, and when branch mining, this entails digging tunnels with torches every eight blocks. (Yes, ten-block spacing would prevent mob spawns while being more economic, but I prefer working in powers of two and would gladly trade that for a 20% increase in torch consumption; after all, torches are renewable through wood and charcoal.) Here is a very basic way to code a Turtle script with this&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">dig</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- digs the block in front</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- moves forward</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">digUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- digs the block above</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1">-- Assume external logic controls the value of isMining</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">isMining</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="n">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="c1">-- dig for eight blocks</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">-- select inventory slot 16 for torches</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">placeUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- place torch above the Turtle</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>While this is technically a functional mining script, there are a number of improvements that could be made. Here are a few that I implemented into my expanded branch mining&nbsp;script.</p>
<p>The one thing in the game that is more annoying than <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/wiki/Creeper">Creepers</a> is, at least in my opinion, <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gravel">gravel</a>, because it often unexpectedly begins to suffocates you. I soon figured out that Turtles have an interesting interaction with gravel. Consider the manner in which <code>miningIteration()</code> has been coded. On first inspection, it may seem that there is no fault in how this would execute; <code>turtle.forward()</code> would simply fail if gravel fell and was obstructing the path of the Turtle, but the following iteration would mine until all the gravel was gone. However, the loop that instructs the Turtle to place a torch after each <code>miningIteration()</code> would increment even though the Turtle did not actually move anywhere and the next torch would be placed less than eight blocks&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a simple enough fix &#8212; just detect if the Turtle is unable to move forward and if so, dig until it can move forward. Following this, continue through the rest of <code>miningIteration()</code>. Luckily enough, the <a href="http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle_(API)">Turtle <span class="caps">API</span></a> contains a set of functions that allow a Turtle to detect if there is a block in front of, above, or below itself. Here is the function rewritten to use these detection functions instead of movement&nbsp;functions.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">detect</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">dig</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">detectUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">digUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, this function is still flawed, though the cause of the problem may not be obvious to someone unfamiliar with Minecraft. Though stationary blocks are what make up the core of the game, there is another class of objects known as entities, which includes not only boats and minecarts but also sand and gravel while they are falling. These entities have a position, velocity, and rotation, and are affected by the game&#8217;s physics. When the game logic detects that the block underneath a stationary sand or gravel block becomes an air block, the stationary block is converted into an entity and begins to fall until it lands on another solid block (or falls through the <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Void">Void</a>).</p>
<p>If you were to let a Turtle run the current version of <code>miningIteration()</code>, after a while, you would notice that the Turtle still has problems with gravel. When mining, if it encounters a column of gravel above itself, it will move forward during the time that the gravel block is still falling, leaving gravel lying in the middle of the branch mine. Directly after the Turtle had finished executing <code>turtle.digUp()</code>, the gravel block was still in mid-fall, and therefore, <code>turtle.detectUp()</code> returned <code>false</code>. This caused the Turtle to simply continued mining and not stop to mine the gravel above&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>My solution to this was to halt the program for just the right amount of time so that it would detect gravel after it had fallen. This timing turned out to be 0.2 seconds, so adding <code>sleep(0.2)</code> directly after <code>turtle.dig()</code> and <code>turtle.digUp()</code> forces the Turtle to halt for a brief period of time and mine columns of gravel correctly without sacrificing too much&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">detect</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">dig</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">forward</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">detectUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">digUp</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another interesting behaviour that needed to be debugged was directional-based. Minecraft has many direction-specific quirks due to the way that the game logic was programmed in. This usually results in either south or west sides of blocks being prioritized in some manner. <code>turtle.placeUp()</code> instructs a Turtle to place whatever is in the selected block of its inventory above itself. For solid blocks, this is no problem. However, in the case of non-solid blocks like torches, they will snap to an adjacent block face. The west face is prioritized, followed by the east, north, and south faces&nbsp;successively.</p>
<p>This has implications in terms of torch placement. This behaviour means that mining in the northwards and southwards direction requires no special treatment when it comes to placing to placing torches. In the remaining two directions, though, the torch will ends up on the block that the Turtle will mine in the next iteration of the loop. Unfortunately, the core version of ComputerCraft does not provide a way for Turtles to automatically determine what direction they are facing (mods such as <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4587-cc153mc152-miscperipherals-33/">MiscPeripherals</a> can add more Turtles to the game). Utilizing a <span class="caps">GPS</span> signal to determine the axis that the Turtle is travelling in would be the only way to add this functionality without any external peripherals. As I do not yet have any <a href="http://computercraft.info/wiki/Gps_(API)"><span class="caps">GPS</span> towers</a> set up in my ComputerCraft world, I opted to have the Turtle prompt the user for the direction that it is&nbsp;facing.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">direction</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">direction</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        <span class="n">miningIteration</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- complete one more mining iteration</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">back</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">-- go back one block and place torch</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">placeUp</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">turtle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">placeUp</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With these changes, if the Turtle is facing a direction that would result in the torch being placed in one of the two problematic directions, the Turtle will simply complete an extra iteration of mining and then backtrack one block. When <code>turtle.placeUp()</code> is called, only the left and right walls are valid locations for a torch so they get placed on one of the two (the left wall for northwards mining and the right wall for southwards&nbsp;mining).</p>
<p>Because this Turtle would theoretically mine until it is out of fuel, it would go quite a long distance. The underground of the Minecraft world is not solid rock, and it is chock-full of lava pools and empty caverns. In an equilibrium between safety and speed, the Turtle checks below itself for a non-solid block (air, lava, or water). If so, the Turtle places a block from slot one of its inventory (which would contain Cobblestone or another dispensable block type) to create a safe pathway for the Turtle&#8217;s retrieval. In practice, <code>turtle.detectDown()</code> does not take any time to be carried out, so there is virtually no drop in mining speed while digging through completely solid rock. If the program were to build railings on both sides of the path, the Turtle would need to rotate four times per iteration instead of zero times, which would be extremely inefficient as Turtle rotations are&nbsp;slow.</p>
<p>Another benefit of programming through ComputerCraft is that ideas for new features or added functionality arise simply by using the program. Perhaps the mining script could be extended to automatically return to the start of the branch when its inventory is full. Maybe it could automatically throw out Cobblestone and only keep ores. Or perhaps fuel could be a factor: returning when low on fuel or automatically consuming fuel sources mined in order to keep&nbsp;mining.</p>
<p>If something unexpected were to happen to a Turtle on a long mining expedition, it might get stuck underground with its haul of resources and many resources would have to spent (time and materials) to locate and retrieve it. To avoid this, it would be wise to debug the Turtle&#8217;s movements in a low-risk environment before actually deploying it on a mining expedition. This might include checking to see how the Turtle would react if a wandering mob would obstruct its movement. Because of this, ComputerCraft inherently teaches error handling and&nbsp;debugging.</p>
<p>This process of taking a basic program and expanding it could be applied to many different types of ComputerCraft&nbsp;scripts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In an classroom setting, ComputerCraft could be used to create coding assignments for students. An interesting result of this setup is that everyone could simply connect to the same <span class="caps">LAN</span> world through pit their Turtle scripts against one another in order to determine whose algorithm is the most efficient; after all, friendly competition is always a good&nbsp;motivator.</p>
<p>I feel that ComputerCraft is a great way to teach people who are already interested in Minecraft the basics of programming. Lua is a very beginner friendly programming language, featuring a syntax similar to regular English much like Logo, and Turtles are almost certainly more engaging to a novice programmer than an interactive Lua prompt within a terminal. With ComputerCraft, <s>the sky</s> <code>Y = 255</code> is the&nbsp;limit.</p></div>
